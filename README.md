# Neural Synchrony Provides a Grouping Mechanism for Figure-Ground Segregation in Texture Stimuli

Neural grouping mechanisms are thought to integrate image elements that define
a figure and segregate them from the background in texture stimuli.  Neural synchrony is a likely candidate for this grouping mechanism. According to the theory of weakly coupled oscillators (TWCO), the success or failure of synchronization among weakly coupled oscillators is determined by two factors: the dissimilarity of their intrinsic frequencies (detuning) and the strength of their coupling. These factors are directly related to contrast heterogeneity (the extent to which contrasts are dissimilar) among image elements and to the physical distance between elements, respectively. We, therefore, suggest that the grouping mechanisms underlying figure-ground segregation can be explained in terms of the principles of synchronization in a network of weakly coupled oscillators. 

Furthermore, if synchrony is related to figure-ground segregation performance, then changes in synchrony due to training may enhance the ability to segregate figures from the background. The aim of the present study was to evaluate this intriguing possibility. To that end, we first test the synchronization behaviour in an oscillator model of V1 as a function of (1) contrast heterogeneity among texture elements, (2) the coarseness of an irregular grid on which individual texture elements were placed, and (3) training in texture figure-ground segregation. Using an oscillator model of V1, we compute the
amount of synchronization among oscillators based on detuning, coupling
strength, and practice-induced changes in coupling strength. We investigate to
what extent the synchronization behaviour of the model provides precise
predictions of the behavioural performance of human observers engaged in a
figure-ground segregation task for a large range of texture stimulus conditions,
and experience levels from na√Øve to highly practised.
