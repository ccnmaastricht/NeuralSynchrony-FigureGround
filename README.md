# Adaptive Synchronization of Neural Gamma Oscillations Mediates Figure-Ground Perception in Texture Stimuli

## Abstract
Gamma oscillations are ubiquitous in visual cortex, but their role in perception has been questioned because their frequencies are feature dependent. Drawing on the theory of weakly coupled oscillators (TWCO), we demonstrate that feature-dependence is crucial for gamma's functional role in perception. Two factors determine synchronization behaviour among coupled oscillators: dissimilarity of oscillation frequencies and coupling strength. In early visual cortex these factors relate to local features and physical distance between image elements, respectively. We manipulate these factors in a texture segregation experiment and show that performance follows TWCO predictions both qualitatively and quantitatively, as formalized in a computational model. Furthermore, learning-induced changes in the model's synchronization behaviour predict changes in participants' performance in a perceptual learning experiment. These results suggest that feature-dependence of gamma oscillations is critical for a synchronization-based mechanism of visual scene segmentation. Our findings offer insights into the functional role of gamma oscillations in the brain.

### config
This directory contains TOML configuration files for the analysis, plotting, and simulation scripts. These files specify the parameters used by the scripts and allow for easy configuration of the project.

### data
This directory contains the data used in the project. The Snakemake workflow of the project automatically downloads CSV data files from Zenodo and places them in this directory. The data includes human psychophysics data on figure-ground segregation in texture stimuli.

### notebooks
This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploring and reporting results as well as for generating additional figures. These notebooks provide an interactive environment for analyzing data and visualizing results.

### results
This directory contains the results generated by the scripts. Results are organized into subdirectories following the same structure as the organization of scripts into subdirectories.

### scripts
This directory contains scripts for simulations, analysis, statistics, plotting, and querying system information. Each script is designed to perform a specific task within the Snakemake workflow. The scripts are organized into subdirectories based on their functionality.

### src
This directory contains Python source code for the project. The __init__.py file is used to mark the directory as a Python package. The source code includes classes and functions for model simulations, analyzing data, statistics, and generating figures.
