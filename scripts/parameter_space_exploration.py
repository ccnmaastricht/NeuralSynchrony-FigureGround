"""
This script explores the decay rate (lambda) and maximum coupling (gamma) parameter space of the model
 and generates an Arnold Tongue for each combination of parameters, and compares the results to behavioral data.
Results are saved in ../data/simulation_results/parameter_space_exploration.npy and correspond to section X of the paper.
Figures are saved in ../figures/parameter_space_exploration.png and correspond to Figures Y and Z of the paper.
